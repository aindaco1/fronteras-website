The Fulcrum Fund is an annual grant program created and administered by [516 ARTS](https://516arts.org) as a partner in the Regional Regranting Program of The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, with additional support from the Frederick Hammersley Fund for the Arts at the Albuquerque Community Foundation. The Fulcrum Fund serves as an essential support structure to enable artists to expand existing work and explore new directions in creating and showcasing projects that inspire curiosity, engagement, and dialogue. It is intended to be a springboard for artistic processes that are experimental and forward thinking, while celebrating projects that may not fit into the traditional museum and gallery systems.

## #1 // Outer Wilds
I passed on this game for way too long because I wasn't the biggest fan of the visual style at first. It felt too much like space exploration meets backpacking through Europe. But after having played it, I *still* say that it's like space exploration meets backpacking through Europe, but this time with a positive inflection that doesn't translate to text. It's an amazing experience that I can say ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about. Go in as blind as a bat.

## #2 // Return of the Obra Dinn
An entire ship's crew is dead, with magic you can see the moment of their deaths, and it's your job to figure out all what happened to all 58 people who had the misfortune to find themselves on the Obra Dinn. I loved it so much, and as a very concise mystery game it totally kills it.

## #3 // The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles
Why yes, 2021 WAS the year for mystery games, apparently. I loved the Phoenix Wright games when I was in high school, and I was a bit nervous going into what I considered to be a side game. Well, as a standalone game I honestly consider it top in the series. I spent about 60 hours playing it, then turned around and played it with my wife, THEN turned around again and played it with my sister. Top tier visual novel fodder.

## Honorable Mentions

### Hades
Hades reminded me that I am bisexual, and that I don't hate roguelikes?

### Factorio
I refused to buy it for years because I know I would spend too much time on it. So I bought it and spent too much time on it. I'll probably do it again.

### Metroid Dread
It feels like a crime to put it so low. I played all the Metroid games for the first time leading up to Dread, and all in all it was a super solid entry. It deserves *a little bit* of the crap that it's gotten, but boy howdy some people have nostalgia glasses on. It's tied for my favorite with Super Metroid.

### Monster Hunter Rise
It's the Monster Hunter game that I have put the most hours into, and if that's not how you endorse a MH game IDK what is.

### Stardew Valley
I put an ungodly amount of hours into this game. As an old die hard fan of Story of Seasons, it was bound to happen eventually. Yeah it's good. Dang good.

### Disgaea 6
I have a love hate relationship with Disgaea games. I play for 5 hours, drop it, come back in 6 months, play another 5 hours, repeat. I've made it through the tutorial? I love it so much though.

### Baba Is You
A friendly reminder that I am not as smart as I like to think I am.
