From the bottom of our collective hearts, we thank all the filmmakers for submitting films to the inaugural Fronteras Micro-film Festival! We are blown away by the interest and support from all around the world -- we received entries from México, Canada, France, Australia, the U.K., Iran, and the U.S. We are honored and thrilled to host a truly international festival!

The festival, from concept to execution, is the collective effort of the members of [Dust Wave](https://dustwave.xyz) -- without their passion, diligence, and dedication, none of this would be possible. Specifically, I want to acknowledge the efforts of:

- Jade Stokes (co-organizer)
- Jay Renteria (co-organizer, graphic design)
- Jordyn Bernicke (social media, marketing, promotion)
- Jacklyn Le (social media, marketing)

All of their work has been vital to the festival's success thus far. Miles to go before we sleep, but way to go team!

FYI -- we're moving the notification date to Friday, May 12th. There are lots of films to watch and lots of decisions to make, so we need a bit more time to make our final selections. Thanks for patience as we learn film festival management on the fly!

Again -- thanks a million. We will have our selections ready soon!
